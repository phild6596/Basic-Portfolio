    <p>You dont realize this yet, but one day you will look back at reading
        this short snippet and always be reminded that you made one of
        your best hiring decisions in your life based on this portfolio. I started 
        my journey into computers when I was a small child, interested in learning
        about new ideas and concepts. The puzzle solving, the challenges, the unique 
        relationship every person in the world has with computers, I want to be a 
        part of that.
    </p>

    <p>I was born in Mexico, raised in San Diego. I am bilingual, and that has given me a slight
        advantage in understanding this new coding language. Computers aren't the only interest of 
        mine; I also play guitar, love camping, travel when I get a chance, and my most loved role,
        being a husband and dad. I love tackling every single one of these because they all present 
        their own unique challenge, a different way to see things. I bring that perspective, a man who 
        not only has seen things in his lifetime, but has enough experiences with them to see things 
        and solve problems while looking at them from every possible angle. That's what I bring, and 
        that's what you'll always have in me.
